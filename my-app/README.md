# 🍽 React Food Store

This project is a **React-based food store application** that fetches recipes from the **DummyJSON Recipes API** and allows users to **add and remove items from a shopping cart** with real-time notifications.

## 🧠 About the Project

The **React Food Store** demonstrates how to:
- Integrate an **external REST API** with React  
- Use **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing state and lifecycle  
- Handle **user interactions** such as adding/removing items from a cart  
- Display **toast notifications** using `react-toastify` for better user experience  

The application fetches recipe details including **name, image, and ingredients**, and displays them in a clean card-based layout. Users can easily add items to their cart, view the cart overlay, and remove items as needed.
